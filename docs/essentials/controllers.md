# Routing with Controllers

Controllers are the main architectural blocks of the Ascender Framework. They define the final HTTP endpointsâ€”the tips of the router graph's branches. Controllers manage and process incoming requests, returning appropriate responses.

### Defining a Controller
Each controller in the Ascender Framework contains the following key components:

- A `@Controller` [decorator](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) to define the controller class.
- A Python class with endpoint functions that implement the controller's endpoint behavior.
- Methods wrapped with HTTP method decorators, which define the routes and their behavior.


```python title="user_controller.py" linenums="1"
from ascender.core import Controller

@Controller(
    standalone=False
)
class UserController:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization logic (e.g., inject services here)
        ...
```

---

### Defining Routes of a Controller
Routes are defined by creating methods inside the controller class and wrapping them with specific HTTP method decorators.


```python title="user_controller.py" hl_lines="10-19" linenums="1"
from ascender.core import Controller, Get

@Controller(
    standalone=False
)
class UserController:
    def __init__(self):
        ...

    @Get()
    async def get_all_users(self) -> list[dict]:
        """
        Defines the root endpoint of this controller (`/users`).
        """
        return [
            {"username": "user1", "email": "user1@example.com"},
            {"username": "user2", "email": "user2@example.com"}
        ]
```
In this example, the `get_all_users` method defines a route using the `@Get()` decorator, making it accessible as the root endpoint of the `UserController`.

---

### Combining and Composing Controllers with the Router Graph
The router graph in the Ascender Framework defines routes to controllers and their endpoints. It organizes the application's routing structure into a graph where specific "Route Nodes" are tied to controllers. These route nodes contain information about the controllers' base path, OpenAPI configurations, and child nodes.

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[Router Graph] --> |controller| B(MainController);
  A -->|controller| C(UserController);
  C --> |GET: /| D[get_all_users];
```

```python title="routes.py" hl_lines="8-13" linenums="1"
routes: Sequence[RouterRoute] = [
    {
        "path": "/",
        "controller": MainController,
        "tags": ["Main"],
        "include_in_schema": True
    },
    {
        "path": "/users",
        "controller": UserController,
        "tags": ["Users"],
        "include_in_schema": True
    }
]

__all__ = ["routes"]
```

This example demonstrates how to define routes connecting base paths to controllers, with metadata for OpenAPI documentation and schema inclusion.
