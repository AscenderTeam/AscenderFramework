## What is The Ascender Framework?

The Ascender Framework is a cutting-edge API framework, it’s being maintained by Ascender Team for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend applications. It emphasizes modularity, strong typing, and developer-friendly workflows, inspired by Angular and NestJS but tailored for Python's ecosystem.

### Core Principles

- **Class-Based Architecture**: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) with clear module, service, and controller separation.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Enables clean and testable code with a custom hierarchy based DI system built into the framework.
- **Modularity**: Encourages encapsulation with “modules” that export only what is needed.
- **Performance-Oriented**: Optimized for Python 3.11+ with modern features and minimized runtime overhead.
